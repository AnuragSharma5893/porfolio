      <title>Machine Learning Intern</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-project-that-found-me-&#34;&gt;A Project That Found Me 🚀&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While working as a Full-Stack Developer at OpenNLP Labs, I was deeply involved in projects that blended AI, healthcare, and human cognition 🧠. One of my past experiences involved NLP and computer vision, areas that had always fascinated me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, I was told that openNLP Labs has more projects with an opportunity to work on something even more impactful—a project that could help Alzheimer’s patients preserve their memories and track cognitive changes using AI. It was none other than the Reteena Project, where we aimed to develop adaptive digital twins using LLMs and VLMs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-curiosity-to-opportunity-my-journey-to-opennlp-labs&#34;&gt;From Curiosity to Opportunity: My Journey to OpenNLP Labs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started with my deep fascination for AI and human-computer interaction. I had always been eager to explore how machines understand and process language, which led me to dive deep into Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Search for Opportunities 🚀
During my research internships, I constantly worked on projects that blended AI, psychology, and data science. But I wanted something more—an opportunity where I could apply my ML knowledge in a real-world setting while also honing my software development skills.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Research Assistant at Carnegie Mellon University</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-experience&#34;&gt;My Experience&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate to have the opportunity to work at one of the world’s top university labs—CMU (Carnegie Mellon University) 🏛️✨. For me, CMU felt like a gateway to heaven—a place where I could immerse myself in cutting-edge research and engage with people deeply involved in AI and human biology 🧠🤖, which was truly the cherry on top of the cake 🍰.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my semester exams in late summer, I discovered that some research labs hire undergraduate students remotely as Research Assistants (RA) under PhD candidates. Excited by this, I came across a Computational Biology Lab at CMU 🧬🔬. Without hesitation, I filled out the application form and emailed them about my experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am currently working as a Teaching Intern at Pehchaan The Street School, an NGO dedicated to providing education to underprivileged children 📚✨. My role involves teaching students from elementary to 9th grade, helping them build foundational skills in various subjects, and fostering curiosity and critical thinking 🧠💡. It’s an incredibly rewarding experience, as I get to make a real impact on young minds who otherwise have limited access to quality education. Teaching here has reinforced my belief that education is the most powerful tool for change. 🚀🎓&lt;/p&gt;</description>
