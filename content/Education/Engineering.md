# Why CS major

**"Why Computer Science?"**—a question I’ve been asked countless times. And my answer is always the same: **"I've never done anything outside of this."** 💻🚀  

From the moment my father bought a **computer** for me and my brother, I was **hooked**. The first thing I did? **Opened it up** to see what was inside! 🔧🔍 I can still vividly remember the **DDR1 RAM**, barely **900MB**, yet we spent hours playing games and experimenting with it.  

Even back then, I was **confident** that the world was heading towards a **computer-driven future**. That belief became my biggest motivation for choosing **Computer Science & Engineering**—not just as a field of study but as a **way of life**. 🖥️🔥
