# A Project That Found Me 🚀
While working as a Full-Stack Developer at OpenNLP Labs, I was deeply involved in projects that blended AI, healthcare, and human cognition 🧠. One of my past experiences involved NLP and computer vision, areas that had always fascinated me.

One day, I was told that openNLP Labs has more projects with an opportunity to work on something even more impactful—a project that could help Alzheimer’s patients preserve their memories and track cognitive changes using AI. It was none other than the Reteena Project, where we aimed to develop adaptive digital twins using LLMs and VLMs.

#### The Vision Behind Reteena 🏥
The core idea was to create a personalized AI assistant that could:

- Enhance memory recall by structuring past conversations and interactions 📝
- Analyze cognitive changes over time through AI-driven assessments 📊
- Support families and caregivers by providing insights into the patient’s condition ❤️
- Additionally, we worked on a web platform that could enhance low-field MRI scans, making early Alzheimer’s diagnosis more affordable for a larger population.

#### The Impact and Recognition 🌟
The Project was already successful, our work gained recognition:
- ✅ Accepted at the IEEE BigData Undergraduate & High School Symposium 📃
- ✅ Partnered with Microsoft Founders Hub, gaining access to Azure Cloud Services, developer tools, and expert mentorship ☁️

#### A Full Circle Moment 🎯
Looking back, this project perfectly aligned with my interests—AI, human cognition, and psychology. It was a reminder that every skill and experience we gain along the way eventually leads us to opportunities where we can make a real difference.

Reteena wasn’t just another AI project—it was a mission to bring hope and support to those battling memory loss. And I’m grateful to be a part of it.
