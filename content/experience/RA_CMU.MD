# My Experience

I was fortunate to have the opportunity to work at one of the world’s top university labs—CMU (Carnegie Mellon University) 🏛️✨. For me, CMU felt like a gateway to heaven—a place where I could immerse myself in cutting-edge research and engage with people deeply involved in AI and human biology 🧠🤖, which was truly the cherry on top of the cake 🍰.

After my semester exams in late summer, I discovered that some research labs hire undergraduate students remotely as Research Assistants (RA) under PhD candidates. Excited by this, I came across a Computational Biology Lab at CMU 🧬🔬. Without hesitation, I filled out the application form and emailed them about my experience.

I was thrilled to be selected as an RA under [Prof. Min Xu](https://cbd.cmu.edu/people/xu.html), working under his PhD students on Computer Vision projects 👨‍💻📊. This experience was truly transformative and fueled my passion for interdisciplinary research! 🚀
