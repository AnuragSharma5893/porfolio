I am currently working as a Teaching Intern at Pehchaan The Street School, an NGO dedicated to providing education to underprivileged children ðŸ“šâœ¨. My role involves teaching students from elementary to 9th grade, helping them build foundational skills in various subjects, and fostering curiosity and critical thinking ðŸ§ ðŸ’¡. Itâ€™s an incredibly rewarding experience, as I get to make a real impact on young minds who otherwise have limited access to quality education. Teaching here has reinforced my belief that education is the most powerful tool for change. ðŸš€ðŸŽ“
